telepathy-idle 0.2.1 (2020-11-01)
==================================


Enhancements:

• Port build tools to Python 3 (Michael Catanzaro)

• Add meson build system (Jan Tojnar)

Fixes:

• Update test to Python 3 (Tomi Leppänen)

• Properly handle long IRC messages (polari#147, Michael Catanzaro)

• Fix a critical message from GLib on disconnecting (Guillaume, Diane Trout)

• Fix message corruption on accident bling removal (Florian Muellner)

• Update the certificate for tests (Diane Trout)

• Fix "Invalid utf8" test for Python 3 (Diane Trout)

• Properly handle channels with a '!' at the start of name (Daniel Landau)

telepathy-idle 0.2.0 (2013-10-03)
=================================

This is a new stable branch, recommended for GNOME 3.10-based distributions.

No code changes since 0.1.17.

telepathy-idle 0.1.17 (2013-09-18)
==================================

This is a release candidate for telepathy-idle 0.2, recommended for
use with GNOME 3.10.

Dependencies:

• GLib ≥ 2.32
• telepathy-glib ≥ 0.21

Fixes:

• Don't crash when a channel with multiple requests fails (Sjoerd)

• Add handle-name to RoomList properties (fd.o #65614, Xavier)

• kill async read when disconnecting (fd.o #64923, Lionel Landwerlin)

• Fix tests with automake 1.13 (fd.o #69258, Guillaume)

• Stop using deprecated telepathy-glib API (fd.o #64122 and #69311, Guillaume)

telepathy-idle 0.1.16 (2013-05-01)
==================================

The "smörgåsbord of crashes" release.

Enhancements:

• Add support for interactive TLS certificate validation, fixing the
  regression in 0.1.15 that self-signed certificates could not be used
  any more. (fd.o #57130; Sjoerd, Will)

telepathy-idle 0.1.15 (2013-04-24)
==================================

The “secure by default“ release.

Fixes:

• Validate TLS certificates properly, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
  (CVE-2007-6746, fd.o#63810; Simon)

  This will be a regression for users of IRC-over-SSL servers/proxies that
  do not have a certificate trusted by system-wide CA configuration; they
  will no longer be able to connect. If someone implements fd.o #57130, that
  will provide the ability for those users to approve additional
  certificates.

• Fix compilation and regression tests with GLib 2.36 (Simon)

telepathy-idle 0.1.14 (2012-11-16)
==================================

Wow, what a small number of fixes!

Fixes:

• Parse PONG replies more leniently. bip's PONGs were rejected by
  0.1.13.


telepathy-idle 0.1.13 (2012-11-14)
==================================

Wow, what a lot of fixes!

Enhancements:

• fd.o#23005: initial support for listing rooms. (Jonathon Jongsma)

  It would be better to have support for one of the extensions which
  lets you search rooms rather than getting the entire list from the
  server. If someone wants to work on adding this to Idle and Empathy,
  go for it!

• fd.o#24614: chat room channels now respawn if you Close() them. This
  means that if empathy-chat (or your friendly neighbourhood chat UI)
  crashes, it pops right back up with your channels in it, rather than
  you getting kicked out of all your channels.

  If your UI is using Close() to leave channels, you'll need to change
  it to use RemoveMembers with the SelfHandle property from the Group
  interface. empathy-chat has done this for literally years, and
  tp_channel_leave_async() in telepathy-glib and
  Tp::Channel::requestLeave in telepathy-qt4 do the right thing.

Fixes:

• fd.o#54016: fix for "make -j" safety (Dan Winship)

• fd.o#30741: sending well-formed but invalid UTF-8 no longer gets Idle
  kicked off the bus.

• fd.o#56589: Idle now disconnects if it doesn't get a reply to its pings after
  a while.

• fd.o#49163: don't wedge and stop sending messages in a situation we believe
  was triggered by a short-lived GIO bug.


telepathy-idle 0.1.12 (2012-08-02)
==================================

The “Menomale che Silvio c’è” release.

Dependencies:

• GLib 2.30 is now required. (fd.o#49600)

Fixes:

• Implement the the ActorHandle property on the Subject interface, to fix
  showing who changed the topic in Empathy. (sjoerd)

• fd.o#48084: Idle no longer gets stuck in a 100% CPU loop when the connection
  is lost in some situations. (wjt)

• fd.o#49600: Get rid of deprecated things. (smcv)

• fd.o#51906: Renamed variables to avoid warnings with "-Werror=shadow".
  (Thomas Thurman)

telepathy-idle 0.1.11 (2011-10-28)
==================================

The “Flugufrelsarinn” release.

Enhancements:

• fd.o#21168: Idle now implements the Contacts interface (which has
  officially been mandatory for a while). (wjt)

• fd.o#37145: Rather than using its own home-grown network code, Idle
  now uses GIO. This should make it more robust and maintainable.
  (rishi)

• fd.o#40734: The new Subject interface is now implemented. The old
  Properties interface is no longer supported, and hence various other
  aspects of room configuration are no longer exposed. In future, they
  should be reincarnated on the RoomConfig interface. (wjt)

telepathy-idle 0.1.10 (2011-05-11)
==================================

Enhancements:

* The ContactInfo interface is now implemented, allowing you to discover

Fixes:

  (fd.o#35058, rishi)
* Use AM_PATH_PYTHON to check for more Python versions instead of check for
  each binary (fd.o#36624, ioni)
* NewChannels fired twice when connecting to a bip account (fd.o#28918, rishi)
* Pass the message type to tp_cm_message_new_text (fd.o#37038, sjoerd)

telepathy-idle 0.1.9 (2011-04-11)
=================================

Fixes:

  is no text handler (fd.o#34166, wjt)

* Don't truncate room names at ! in the parser (fd.o #28371, #31343,
  #30609, rishi)
* Using an underscore '_' in IRC login name causes network error
  (fd.o#33913, rishi)
* The 'username' parameter is now validated for its conformance to RFC 2812
  (fd.o#35239, rishi)
* Additionally, the human-readable information from ERROR messages is now
  exposed in the ConnectionError signal's Details dictionary, as
  server-message. (also fd.o#35239, rishi)
* Compile on platforms which don't have strnlen, such as NetBSD-5.1.
  (fd.o#23351, Thomas Klausner)
* Include <netinet/in.h> to fix build failure on DragonFlyBSD
  (fd.o#23352, Hasso Tapper)
