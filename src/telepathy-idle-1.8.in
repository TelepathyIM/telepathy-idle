.SH NAME
telepathy-idle-1 \- Telepathy connection manager for IRC
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@libexecdir@/telepathy\-idle\-1\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Idle implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for Internet Relay Chat,
allowing Telepathy clients like
.BR empathy (1)
to connect to IRC servers.
.PP
It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be
started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBIDLE_LOGFILE\fR=\fIfilename\fR
If set, debug output will go to the given file rather than to stderr.
If \fB+\fR is prepended to the \fIfilename\fR (e.g.
\fBIDLE_LOGFILE=+idle.log\fR), debug output will be appended
to the file; otherwise, any existing file will be replaced.
.TP
.TP
\fBIDLE_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options
(which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
