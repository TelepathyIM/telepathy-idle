telepathy-idle 0.1.13 (UNRELEASED)
==================================

Fixes:

• fd.o#54016: fix for "make -j" safety (Dan Winship)

• fd.o#30741: sending well-formed but invalid UTF-8 no longer gets Idle
  kicked off the bus.

• fd.o#23005: initial support for listing rooms. (Jonathon Jongsma)

  It would be better to have support for one of the extensions which
  lets you search rooms rather than getting the entire list from the
  server. If someone wants to work on adding this to Idle and Empathy,
  go for it!

telepathy-idle 0.1.12 (2012-08-02)
==================================

The “Menomale che Silvio c’è” release.

Dependencies:

Fixes:

• Implement the the ActorHandle property on the Subject interface, to fix
  showing who changed the topic in Empathy. (sjoerd)

• fd.o#48084: Idle no longer gets stuck in a 100% CPU loop when the connection
  is lost in some situations. (wjt)

• fd.o#49600: Get rid of deprecated things. (smcv)

• fd.o#51906: Renamed variables to avoid warnings with "-Werror=shadow".

==================================

Enhancements:

  officially been mandatory for a while). (wjt)

  now uses GIO. This should make it more robust and maintainable.
  (rishi)

• fd.o#40734: The new Subject interface is now implemented. The old
  Properties interface is no longer supported, and hence various other
  aspects of room configuration are no longer exposed. In future, they
  should be reincarnated on the RoomConfig interface. (wjt)
